## Introduction

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on a blockchain, which makes them immutable and transparent. However, like any software, smart contracts can have vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This repository aims to document and share these vulnerabilities to help developers and security researchers improve the security of smart contracts.

## Repository Content

This repository contains a collection of PDF files, each documenting a specific security finding in a smart contract. The findings are categorized by the smart contract and the type of vulnerability.

## Summary of Protocol Findings

Below is a summary of the protocol findings documented in this repository. Each summary provides a brief overview of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and any recommended mitigation strategies.
