## [TempleGold](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/c/2024-07-templegold)
Temple Gold is a claim on future airdrops. Airdrops are farmed token allocations from protocols like Ethena or Origami. We introduce Temple Gold as a non-tradable claim on farmed token allocations. Using auction markets and staking contracts, users can get some emission of TGLD to claim farmed token allocations that temple creates in the future. Users can claim allocations from specialized auctions called Spice auctions.
In the process of the audit, **1 issues were found by me: 1 high, 0 medium, and 0 low**.
