# What is a CodeHawks First Flight?
[First Flights](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights) are smart contract auditing challenges characterized by smaller codebases and different rewards mechanisms from our standard smart contract auditing competitions, making them the perfect testing and learning ground for any aspirant smart contract security auditor.

A new First Flight is announced every month and will be available to participate in on CodeHawks.

Differently from the CodeHawks smart contract auditing competitions, First Flights do not come with monetary prize pools but grant participants XP earned by submitting findings.
