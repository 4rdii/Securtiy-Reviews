# What is a CodeHawks First Flight?

[First Flights](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights) are smart contract auditing challenges characterized by smaller codebases and different reward mechanisms compared to our standard smart contract auditing competitions. They provide the perfect testing and learning ground for any aspiring smart contract security auditor.

A new First Flight is announced every month and will be available to participate in on CodeHawks.

Unlike the CodeHawks smart contract auditing competitions, First Flights do not come with monetary prize pools but grant participants XP earned by submitting findings.

# Participated First Flights

## First Flight #11: Snek-Raffle

Snek-Raffle is an NFT project made using the new Vyper compiler. In the process of the audit, **5 issues were found: 1 high, 2 medium, and 2 low** by me.

## First Flight #12: [Kitty Connect](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clu7ddcsa000fcc387vjv6rpt)

This project allows users to buy a cute cat from our branches and mint an NFT for buying a cat. The NFT will be used to track the cat info and all related data for a particular cat corresponding to their token IDs. Kitty owners can also bridge their NFT from one chain to another via Chainlink CCIP. In the process of the audit, **7 issues were found: 4 high, 2 medium, and 1 low** by me.

## First Flight #13: [Baba Marta](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/cluseb1bf0001s4tjl2rzajup)

The "Baba Marta" protocol allows you to buy MartenitsaTokens and give them away to friends. If you want, you can also be a producer. The producer creates MartenitsaTokens and sells them. There is also a voting system for the best MartenitsaToken. Only producers can participate with their own MartenitsaTokens. Other users can only vote. The winner receives 1 HealthToken. If you are not a producer and want a HealthToken, you can receive one if you have 3 different MartenitsaTokens. More MartenitsaTokens mean more HealthTokens. The HealthToken is a ticket to a special event (producers cannot participate). During this event, each participant has a producer role and can create and sell their own MartenitsaTokens. In the process of the audit, **7 issues were found: 3 high, 2 medium, and 2 low** by me.

## First Flight #14: [AirDropper](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clvb821kr0001jzdbi6ggixb0)

AirDropper is a gas-optimized protocol built to assist with token distribution on the zkSync Era chain. In the process of the audit, **4 issues were found: 4 high, 0 medium, and 0 low** by me.

## First Flight #15: [Mondrian Wallet](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clvxt8idd00014zcc81dv6rde)

Our team loves account abstraction and abstract art, so we decided to combine them! Users who create an account abstraction wallet with MondrianWallet will get a cool account abstraction wallet with a random Mondrian art painting! In the process of the audit, **6 issues were found: 2 high, 3 medium, and 1 low** by me.

## First Flight #16: [Mafia Takedown](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clwgiehgu00119zwn2xx92ay8)

An undercover AMA agent (anti-mafia agency) discovered a protocol used by the Mafia. In several days, a raid will be conducted by the police, and we need as much information as possible about this protocol to prevent any problems. But the AMA doesnâ€™t have any web3 experts on their team. Hawks, they need your help! Find flaws in this protocol and send us your findings. Mafia Takedown is a contract written using a default framework that allows developers to have flexible and upgradable contracts. In the process of the audit, **5 issues were found: 1 high, 2 medium, and 2 low** by me.
